# Personal website

This is the code for my personal website. It is a static website with a blog that is generated by a Python script that parses posts from plain Markdown files.

My first approach was to make the Python script an open source static website generator, but I have now decided to begin with making a tailored script for just my own website. The idea is that this will make the development of my own site a lot easier. The script can later on be modified to be available independently from the site.

## Dependencies

Uses Python 3.5.1. Install dependencies with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
